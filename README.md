# MVC React Demo

This document has been auto-generated by Claude Sonnet 4.

A demonstration of **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture pattern implemented with modern React technologies and feature-based organization.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project showcases an **industry-standard feature-based MVC architecture** in React:

### **Feature-Based Organization**

- **Posts Feature**: Complete CRUD operations with UUID-based IDs
- **Users Feature**: User management and display
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Reusable types, services, and utilities

### **Model Layer**

- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces in `src/shared/types/`
- **API Services**: Axios-based API client in `src/shared/services/`
- **Data Logic**: Centralized API calls with UUID support

### **View Layer**

- **Components**: Feature-specific UI components
- **Pages**: Top-level page components in `src/pages/`
- **Presentation Logic**: Pure UI components with Material-UI

### **Controller Layer**

- **Custom Hooks**: Business logic in each feature's controllers
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management with caching
- **State Coordination**: Manages data flow and user interactions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- Yarn 4

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev     # Start with mock API (default)
   yarn build   # Build for production
   yarn test        # Run test suite
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port)

## 🔶 Mock API & UUID Implementation

This project includes a **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** setup with **UUID-based post IDs** that simulates a real API environment.

### Key Features

- **UUID v4 Post IDs**: All posts use unique string identifiers (server-generated)
- **Artificial Delays**: 1000ms delays simulate real network conditions
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete with proper validation
- **Test Environment**: Separate test handlers with mocked UUIDs
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage for UUID transitions

### UUID Implementation

- **Server-side Generation**: UUIDs generated in MSW handlers (realistic approach)
- **String-based IDs**: Migrated from numeric to UUID string identifiers
- **Test Compatibility**: Vitest with MSW handles UUID generation consistently
- **Production Ready**: Architecture supports real API UUID implementation

### Development vs Production

```bash
yarn dev     # Mock API with UUIDs and delays
yarn test        # Test suite with mocked UUIDs
yarn build   # Production build (ready for real API)
```

### Mock Data

The mock API provides:

- **5 Posts** with UUID identifiers and realistic content
- **2 Users** with complete profile information
- **Full CRUD Support** for posts with optimistic updates
- **Error Scenarios** for comprehensive testing

### Testing Infrastructure

- **Separate Test Handlers**: Isolated mock environment for tests
- **UUID Mocking**: Consistent `'mocked-uuid-v4'` for predictable tests
- **Vitest Integration**: MSW configured for seamless test execution with vitest

## 🔄 MVC Implementation Details

### Model Layer (`src/shared/types/`, `src/shared/services/`)

- **Types**: Defines data structures with UUID support (Post, User, API responses)
- **API Service**: Centralized HTTP client with interceptors and error handling
- **Data Validation**: TypeScript ensures type safety across UUID transitions

### View Layer (`src/features/*/view/`, `src/pages/`)

- **Feature Components**: Organized by business domain (posts, users)
- **Pure Presentation**: Components receive data and callbacks, no business logic
- **Material-UI**: Consistent design system with responsive layouts

### Controller Layer (`src/features/*/controllers/`, `src/features/*/hooks/`)

- **Feature Controllers**: Business logic encapsulated within each feature
- **TanStack Query**: Handles caching, background updates, and optimistic updates
- **UUID Handling**: Manages server-generated vs client-side ID strategies

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
yarn test                # Run all tests
yarn test:coverage # Run with coverage report
```
